# PERCEIVE

PERCEIVE is a project incubator inspired by [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/) and [Stack Exchange's Area 51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/). It serves as a **staging zone** repository for the project early ideas, most of which done in either Python or R Notebooks by one of the project's [contributors](https://github.com/sailuh/perceive/graphs/contributors). All projects share the common goal to support the identification of software vulnerabilities in the "wild," and function as different components of a single system to achieve this goal.
