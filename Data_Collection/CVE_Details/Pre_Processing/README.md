This script is simple a counter of the number of rejected entries and candidate entries for CVE MItre.
To acquire the file, go to CVE Mitre website, then to its download page, then the CVS category and download the file (it will be entire corpus). It will contain about 7 fields,
(notice it has more than CVE Details since this one is raw, and on CVE Details Pal already extract what is needed). 

This script was created as part of the merge script, we should create something similar for NVD as well in the future, so we can unify the datasets into a single vulnerability dataset.
