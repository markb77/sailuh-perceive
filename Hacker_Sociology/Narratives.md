#Q1-What do hackers think when finding a software vulnerability#

Hackers will conduct deviant acts upon a software vulnerability if (1) they have built a metal model which can predict the software's behavior (1, p20) ,(2) their skills and knowledge match the challenge (2, p7), (3) they feel fun and excitement (5, p12), (4) They know some peers have done the similar action before, so it is OK for him to do it as well (15, p23), (5) They believe it is the victims fault for having the vulnerability (8, p5).

<br>
#Q2-What medium do hackers collaborate (if at all): Whiteboard? Online forum? Blog comments? What? If a famous site does take note as it can be ore data to our group.#
Hackers mostly communicate on web forums where they share knowledge and gain reputation by competing with each other (11, p6). In some cases, hackers attend conferences as one side of their "double life" (16, p9). And young hackers also may communicate via their college bulletin-board system sites (10, p7). 
<br>
<br>
#Q3-Do they work alone or in groups? Does the work claim anything about them working individually or in groups? #
Most of the work suggested that hackers work alone. However, they may still carry out team efforts. Most of the hacker groups are short-lived with a few releases. (13, p13). Similar to individual hacker compete with other individuals, hack groups also compete (13, p6).  A special hacker group effort case is when hackers feel their nations or religions are offended (9, p12).

#Conclusion #
You need to be both mentally "ill" enough and technologically skilled enough to become a hacker. 
Hackers learn from each other through web forums, and they are willing to share information with the others which promotes the advancement of hack community. They seek freedom, and the hacking culture advocates self-learning, thus, they mostly work alone than work as groups.

#PERCEIVE#
The PERCEIVE project may be benefited from this work by expanding the Email treads to web forums since the majority of the communication took place on web forums. It would be easier to identify the center of the communications and easier to identify the key hackers. In reality,  a few hackers are skilled enough to conduct serious criminal deviant acts; they are very likely the key hackers. Following the key hackers' communication, we may identify software vulnerabilities.
