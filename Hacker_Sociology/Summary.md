##Summary of How Hackers Think: A Study of Cybersecurity Experts and Their Mental Models##
<br /><br />
While most of the study about hackers have focused on individual and social behavioral traits base on personality and motivation profiling which is severely limited within hacker communities, this paper focused on hackers’ psychological development and cognitive processing. This approach offers us the opportunity to understand how hackers make decisions and solve problems.<br /> 

The researchers chose eighteen hackers as their samples and interviewed them with open-ended questions. The goal was to collect hackers’ mental and social hacking methodologies and reveal the domain of topics. Combing the answers and the field observational notes, the researchers identified five main themes: (1) cognitive patterns; (2) learning patterns; (3) comprehension patterns; (4) engaged patterns; and (5) predictive patterns within the hackers.<br />

The researchers found out that the hackers operate in an environment with high uncertainty. They have vague ideas of how the components within the system interact with each other and how the system interacts with other systems. The uncertainty can be alleviated by a mental model which reflects the how the system works. Taking advantage of the mental model, the hackers would able to manipulate the system. The rest of the paper talks about how hackers come up a mental model by applying the five main themes. Note that hackers may work as a group. Comprehension patterns and engaged patterns are the patterns which reflect hackers work collaboratively to build an effective mental model. <br />

In cognitive patterns, hackers identify a problem and initiate thinking. Learning patterns define hackers apply their prior knowledge and resources to the problem. Comprehension patterns and engaged patterns are where the hackers work collaboratively to build a model. Engaged patterns involved more direct interactions, like arguments and debates, but comprehension may only take place on online forums. For example, a hacker learns hacking technics by searching for relative posts. Predictive patterns happen when hackers have already acquired sufficient knowledge about the system and hence, capable of making predictions on the system’s future behaviors. <br />

The paper also mentioned that hackers use diagrams, narratives, arguments, and debate to understand the logic and share their expertise.

#Summary of the Myth of the Computer Hacker#
</br>
This study raised an argument that the general public’s the conception on computer hackers is misled. There is a gap the between the myth of the hackers and the reality of hackers. In the myth, the hackers are recognized to possess sophisticated computer skills and represents a threat because of their desire to use these skills in pursuit of criminal wrong-doing.  In reality, only a few computer hackers possess sufficient skills or desire to commit more than nuisance crimes (Reid 2002). 
</br>
</br>
The study addressed that in the mid-80s, the public started to concern about hackers’ “superpower” as the release of the movie WAR GAMES. In the movie, the young hacker is far more knowledgeable than bumbling adults that give him power and authority. With limited exposure to the computer world, hackers’ behavior was classified as a psychological disorder. Later, the computerization of society averted the initial misclassification as more people have access to personal computers. In the meantime, the public realized the increased damage could be done by hackers. Business owners demanded legal intervention, shifting hacking from a nuisance to a crime. The computer security industry played another crucial role in codifying the hacker’s myth. By exaggerating the severity of hacking, the industry grew from $2 billion to $7.4 billion by 2003(Reid 2002). The statistical support for the hacker myth was proven to be fraud. Prior research failed to define an attack. And the vast majority of attacks reported were nothing more than nuisances. A closer look at the reports also discovered that most hackers have limited computer skills.

#Summary of Hacker’s Accounts- Hacking as a Social Entertainment#


This study strives to examine the social construction of the reality among Israeli computer hackers through the accounts they use to explain their deviant. An account is a statement made by the social actor to explain unanticipated or untoward behavior, not routine, the commonsense behavior of motives are used to determine behaviors and expectations when faced by other people’s responses to different situations (Mills, 1940). In other words, the study identifies how hackers justify their behaviors. 

The research applied ground theory in particular and qualitative research in general. Fifty-Four Israeli hackers who were interviewed and asked about their life stories. Taking advantage of the qualitative data, the researchers yielded ten categories of accounts used by hackers, from the most frequently mentioned to the least: (a) fun, thrill, and excitement; (b) curiosity for its own sake—a need to know; (c) computer virtuosity; (d) economic accounts—ideological opposition, lack of money, monetary rewards; (e) deterrent factor; (f) lack of malicious or harmful intentions; (g) intangible offenses; (h) nosy curiosity and voyeurism; (i) revenge; and, (j) ease of execution (Turgeman-Goldschmidt, 2005).

(a) Fun, thrill, and excitement: receiving enjoyment by breaking in

(b) Curiosity for its own sake: learning as much as possible

(c) Computer virtuosity: gaining power, dominance, and competitiveness

(d) Economic accounts: (1) feeling the price charged by software companies too high and unfair (2) lacking money - if I had money, I would pay (3) Making a little “pocket money”

(e) Deterrent factor: Stopping hacking only when the probability of being caught is high and will receive severe punishment. 

(f) Lack of malicious or harmful intentions: peeping isn’t editing. I don’t change files, only download and read.

(g) Intangible offenses: Making a copy isn’t stealing. The original file stays, so there is no damage done.

(h) Nosy curiosity and voyeurism: Peeping satisfies the desire to know. And I expect others do the same to me. 

(i) Revenge: Making even for someone who offended me.

(j) Ease of execution: Breaking in is just too easy not to do.

#Summary of the Flow-Based Model of Computer Hackers’ Motivation.#
<br />
<br />
The researchers strived to investigate hackers’ motivation (why hackers hack) via the flow paradigm.  Flow means that an action freely follows the previous action, and the process is in a way unconscious, flow is accompanied by positive emotions and is self-rewarding (Voiskounsky, Smyslova, 2003). The initial hypothesis is hackers’ intrinsic motivation has a positive correlation with the flow. 
<br />
<br />
Two groups of hackers consist of the research samples. One is more competent with years of experience in IT and sufficient knowledge and skills in multiple programming languages while the other group of hackers was less competent. The researchers applied four-point Likert-type questionnaires for the non-selected hackers (samples), scales ranging from “strong disagree” to “strong agree”, to measure hackers flow. In case of the inter-group issue, some hackers belong to either of the two groups (some hackers’ skill are mediocre). Researchers applied cluster analysis and regrouped the samples into three clusters. The results show hackers have the least and most experiences have high flow. But the mediocre hackers experience low flow. Hence, the hypothesis is WRONG, since flow doesn’t increase as the increase of hacks’ competence (Voiskounsky, Smyslova, 2003).
<br />
<br />
Base on the flow/non-flow ratio, the researchers developed a motivational model of hackers’ development. The model is based on a balance between the level of computer and IT skills and the level of challenges in hacking. Inexperienced hackers feel motivated as the challenge is low and experienced hackers also feel motivated in hacking as the challenge is high. In other words, hackers experience high flow as the challenge matches their skill level. On the other hand, hackers experience low flow as their skills mismatch the challenge (either they are too good or not good enough). Hackers who experience a flow crisis (low flow) tend to pause hacking until the skill/challenge balance is restored. Some of them may never find a solution, and some of them may switch career, become a cybersecurity expert.

#Summary of Red Team Performance for Improved Computer Security#
<br />
<br />
The research is to identify and define the various dimension of red team effectiveness with the aim of improving red team performance (Kraemer, Carayon, Duggan, 2004). A red team is a group of “ethical hackers” work together to seek system vulnerabilities and execute attacks on the system. The goal is to discover loopholes in systems for the operators.  
<br />
<br />
The researchers define four primary types of team performance measures:  (1) descriptive measures (i.e.process), which describe what is happening at any given time and seek to document individual and team behaviors; (2) evaluative measures (i.e. outcome), which judge performance against identifiable standards and serve to answer questions of effectiveness; and (3) diagnostic measures (i.e. process),which seek to identify causes of behavior and question how and why things occurred as they did (Paris, Salas, & Cannon Bowers, 2000). (4) Diagnostic measures contribute to inputs to the feedback process necessary to improve subsequent performance (Salas & Cannon-Bowers, 1997). 
<br />
<br />
Fifteen Individual interviews were conducted along with two focus groups. Findings are reported in measurement category totals and most frequently cited measurement type. In individual perspective, the most commented measurement type is diagnostic. In team perspective, most commented are evaluative and diagnostic. In management, the most commented is descriptive. In customer perspective, most commented is descriptive.

#Summary of Hacking into the Minds of Hackers#
<br />
<br />
The research strives to address the perceptions of hackers and how these perceptions impact the hackers’ decision to engage or not to engage in the illegal hacking activities. The perceptions of hackers include:<br />
<br />
Moral disengagement: the cognitive process that justifies deviant conduct (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Gian, & Pastorelli, 1996). People only conduct illegal behaviors when they have justified the rightness of their behavior.
<br />
<br />Informational sanctions: determines whether my deviant conduct will tarnish individual’s reputation and shame the family. <br />
<br />
Punishment severity: the impact on an individual due to deviant conduct.<br />
<br />
Punishment certainty: measures an individuals’ perception of the probability of being caught (Young et al., 2007).<br />
<br />
Utility value: evaluates between the gain from misconduct and the potential risks. <br />
<br />
Study methods: survey handed out to 127 people at the DefCon conference. Through the survey, discovered 54 individuals conduct illegal hacking last year (active hackers). 73 individuals didn’t hack last year (other attendees). The same survey handed out to undergraduate students and received 136 responses. Only one active hacker within the students. Compare the perceptions of hackers between the active hackers, other attendees, and students.<br />
<br />
Findings: hackers have a significantly higher level of moral disengagement, and they disregard any negative consequences of hacking by blaming the victims. Hackers perceive a significantly lower level of informal sanction. Hackers believe their family would not think less of them if they were caught hacking and they are not afraid of being alienated. Hackers are aware of the severity of the punishment of hacking, but the students are not. Hackers perceive a significant lower possibility of being caught. Overall, the perceptions of being caught are low across the three groups. Hackers perceive high utility value; they believe gains of hacking exceed perceived costs.

#Summary of Examining the Social Network of Malware Writers and Hackers#
<br />
<br />
This study tries to answer how skill and ability impact individual position with hacker social networks, the general distribution of hackers within larger on-line networks and how information may flow within social networks online due to variations in induvial capability by examining the structure of the members of multiple Russian hackers and malware writing groups (Holt et al., 2012).
<br />
<br />
Study method: 336 individuals engage in hacking was identified through a Russian social network. They were group into three categories, depending on their hacking skills level: (1) no risk, (2) second risk and (3) high risk. In the meantime, those identified hackers belong to at least one of the eight hacking communities. Network analysis was conducted to indicate the centrality of the high-risk hackers. Exploratory techniques were conducted to study the structure of networks and to identify where high threat hackers reside within social network relative to other lower skilled hackers. A t-test with unequal variances was conducted to test if a high-risk level hacker belongs to more than one hacking community. ANOVA analyses suggest that group member that predict the overall risk. Hackers in more than one group (community) are riskier.
<br />
<br />
Findings: high-risk hackers are centered on the hacker social network. They either are the members of multiple hacking communists, or they have people connection across different communities. The tools created by the high-risk hackers flow down to the low-risk hackers, suggesting hackers share information and innovations.

#Summary of Techcrafters and Makecrafters: A Comparison of Two Populations of Hackers#

<br />
<br />
This study culturally allocates the hackers into two groups: techcrafters (using existing knowledge and tools) and makecrafters (creating new tools and finding new ways of hacking) and test the following hypotheses across the two groups:
<br />
<br />
(1)    Hackers “in the wild” (makecrafters) perceived high skill with computer technology versus the control group (techcrafters).<br />
(2)    Hackers “in the wild” have more hacker friends.<br />
(3)    Hackers “in the wild” spend more time with others on-line.<br />
(4) Hackers "in the wild" will score higher on a legitimizing scales of unethical hacking activities. <br />
(5) Hackers "in the wild" will score lower regarding perceived knowledge of what is proper and improper behavior on-line.<br />
(6) Hackers "in the wild" group will have lower self-control.<br />
<br />
Study methods: survey two unique venues: two hacker conventions (the “in the wild” group, n=35) and an academic course on information security (the control group, n=19). <br />
<br />
Findings:  the hypotheses 1-4 are confirmed. However, two group share the same awareness of ethical behaviors in on-line environment, and they share similar self-control level, suggesting self-control may be critical to be a makecraft and a techcraft hacker.

#Summary of Why Computer Talents Become Computer Hackers#
<br />
The paper answers: (1) how do hackers get started? (2) How and why do they evolve from innocent behavior to criminal acts by interviewing six Chinese hackers.
The research finds out:
<br />
<br />
(1)    Computer hackers start out as talented students, curious and fascinated by computers. They are not interest in their major courses and would rather spend more time to explore the computer world.
<br />
<br />  
(2)    The porous system security in school allows computer hackers to hack and practice. The school administrators and teachers tolerate such behavior because those smarts students win programming competitions which benefit the school. 
<br />
<br />
(3)    Moral values and judgement is the only reliable differentiator between gray hats and black hats.
<br />

#Summary of Computer Hackers in Virtual Community Forums: Identity Shaping and Dominating Other Hackers#
<br />
The paper answers (1) how hackers create an environment where identities form and superiority of knowledge is used to dominant others by examining hacker virtual communities.<br />
<br />
The study analyzed the forms in hacker virtual communities and find out hackers want them to be known and remembered when displaying hacking knowledge and compete against each other. In the meantime, they want to remain anonymous when accounting on their hacking actions.

#The Summary of the Attack Dynamics of Political and Religiously Motivated Hackers #
<br />
The paper explores the specific motives of religion and nationalism affect hacker attitudes and activities using multiple qualitative data sets.
The data was collected from six websites operated by and for Turkish hackers and a series of 10 in-depth interviews.<br />
<br />
The findings:

(1)    Hackers gain knowledge and skills through individual learning and peer mentoring in hack communities.<br />
<br />
(2)    Hackers are mission-driven, with attacks against targets often based on religious and national beliefs.

#Summary of Social Network Analysis of a Criminal Hacker Community#
This study analyzed: <br />
•    What is the network centralization of a computer hacker network?<br />
•    Are there members of a hacker network who stand out as critical leaders?<br />
•    How strongly do leaders influence a hacker network?<br />
•    What subgroups exist and interact in a hacker network?<br /><br />
Using text searching (number of texts: 115 and 14,000 unique concepts) approach for collecting information about a hacker web community (Shadowcrew).<br /><br />
The researchers considered the degree centrality, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centrality of the hackers.  The results showed that Shadowcrew was a decentralized network with a few leaders. Leaders had high degree centrality. One specific leader was influential to many others. Some hackers’ networks were directly involved in sub-groups. The research concluded that Shadowcrew had an elaborate division of labor. Thus it had adopted a team organization structure.

#Summary of Welcome to the Scene: A Study of Social Organization and Recognition among Warez Hackers#
<br />
<br />
This study answered the how hacker groups were recognized and the social structure of hacker groups by retrieving the information within “NFO” files. An “NFO” file is a “read-me” file for each cracked software which consists of the software information and the information of the hacking group.<br />
<br />
The research concluded that hacker groups have a short lifespan and each of them had a little number of releases. They charged a low price for the releases. The main motivation is instead, gaining recognition and compete with other hack groups. Each hack group tends to specialize in one particular commodity (PCs, game consoles, videos, etc.).

#Summary of The New Computer Hacker’s Quest and Contest with the Experienced Hackers: A Qualitative Study applying Pierre Bourdieu’s Field Theory#
<br /><br />
This study researched on how newbies try to become accepted computer hackers using Pierre Bourdieu’s Field Theory and its concepts. 500 posts from a forum were analyzed, containing conversations between newbie and experienced hackers.<br /><br />
The results showed that experienced hackers would use their cultural and social capital to either advance or suppress the advancement of the newbie. The experienced hackers will teach the newbie how to hack and give them advice but will also ban, warm, and admonish newbies if they ask for how to perform illegal hacking activities.

#Summary of Security Cyberspace: Identifying Key Actors in Hacker Community#
<br />
<br />
This study strived to answer the following questions:<br />
1: How does the behavior of an individual hacker affect how other hackers perceive them?<br />
2: In what ways can hack build their reputation within hacker communities?<br />
3: Are hacker community different across cultures? US vs. China
<br />
<br />
The researchers introduced an OLS regression model. They used the model to exam two online hacker communities, one in American, the other one in China. The dependent variable was Reputation. The Independent variables were: Average Message Length, Number of Threads Involved, Tenure, Sum of Attachments, Total Messages.<br />
<br />
The study confirmed that sum of attachments and total message volume significantly correlated to reputation. The reputation gaining processes were identical across the two online hacker communities. The study concluded that the individuals contributed to the advancement of the hacker communities are mostly respected by the others within the community.

#Summary of the Professionalization Paths of Hackers in IT security: The sociology of a divided identity#
<br />
<br />
This study answered what professional paths pursued by hackers. 
The researchers introduced biographical analysis and interviewed 27 hackers regarding their careers.<br />
<br />
The researchers concluded the following four professional paths.<br /><br />
(1)    Being employed in an IT security position<br />
Hackers took this path usually well-paid. Hackers start from a peripheral position (intrusion test), then moved up to probing, followed by secure architecture consulting and eventually, being a security engineer.    
The upward shifting mostly achieved by switching to different workplaces instead of climbing the corporate ladder.<br />  
(2)    Setting up a personal company<br />
Hackers wish to maintain a degree of freedom. The decision was initiated by feeling bitterness about others benefiting from the software they built and distributed for free. <br /><br />
(3)    Choosing to have a “double life”<br />
Hackers receive dubious requests and carry out those requests while might having a typical professional path.<br /><br />
(4)    Being part of the fraud and organized gang<br />
Hackers chose to benefit from criminal acts and gave up on a typical professional path completely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

#Summary of Social Learning and Cyber-Deviance: Examining the Importance of a Full Social Learning Model in the Virtual World#<br /><br />
This study explained the large variation in cyber deviance by accessing the social learning process. <br /><br />
The research method was using a self-report survey regarding college student’s computer activities, perceptions, and beliefs.<br /><br />
The study concluded:<br /><br />
(1) Social learning is modeled as a second-order construct with four first-order components:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differential association: Individual who associates with those who commit computer deviance are more likely to commit computer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deviance themselves. (Holt,Burruss,and Bossler, 2010)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinforcement: the reward is given to deviant behaviors. Include positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imitation: Imitation of family members influenced piracy while teacher encouragement and participation in electronic bulletin boards &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased the likelihood of guessing passwords and other deviant acts (Skinner and Fream, 1997).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition: individual’s attitude toward and perception of certain behaviors, and include justifications and excuses for deviant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior that neutralize the potential negative ramifications of deviance (Akers, 1998)<br /><br />
(2) Social learning mediates the effects of race, gender, and computer skill on cyber-deviance.<br /><br />
(3) Those less likely to engage in deviant social learning process are less likely to commit deviant computer acts.
